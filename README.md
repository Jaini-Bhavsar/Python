This repository contains some Python projects.

## 1. Analyzing Marketing Campaign
### Goal
The project's goal was to apply Python and pandas to analyze marketing data and translate data science technical skills into practical insights. It aimed to answer key business questions, such as campaign performance and channel effectiveness, using a simulated online subscription business dataset.

### Skills Utilized
Python Programming
Pandas: Importing datasets, data manipulation (merging, slicing, grouping), updating data types, adding new columns
Matplotlib: Data visualization
Statistical Analysis: Calculating conversion and retention rates, A/B testing
Data Cleaning: Resolving inconsistencies and preparing data for analysis

### Business Relevance
It provided actionable insights on campaign performance and channel effectiveness, aiding strategic decision-making and optimization of marketing efforts.

## 2. Movie Features Correlation in Python
- Taken the movie dataset from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/danielgrijalvas/movies
- Used some libraries such as Panda, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib to perform some operations.
- Plotted correlation between all the features of the dataset.
- Used Jupyter Notebook to write the code.
