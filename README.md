## 3. Retail Sales Forecast: Advanced Time Series Analysis
### Goal
The goal of this project was to forecast retail sales using advanced time series analysis techniques. By leveraging historical sales data from a Superstore dataset, the project aimed to predict future sales trends, identify seasonal patterns, and provide actionable insights to optimize inventory management and improve strategic decision-making.

### Skills Utilized
* Data Cleaning and Preparation: Processed raw sales data by removing unnecessary columns, handling missing values, and aggregating sales by date.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized data to uncover trends, seasonality, and patterns using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
* Time Series Decomposition: Decomposed the sales data into trend, seasonality, and noise components to understand underlying patterns.
* Modeling and Forecasting: Utilized ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and Prophet models to build robust forecasts. Conducted parameter tuning and validation to optimize model performance.
* Validation and Metrics: Evaluated model accuracy using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
* Visualization: Created detailed visualizations to compare observed and forecasted sales, highlighting key trends and future predictions.

### Results and Insights
* Accurate Forecasts: The ARIMA and Prophet models provided accurate sales forecasts, with the ARIMA model achieving a low MSE of 22993.58 and an RMSE of 151.64.
* Seasonal Patterns: Identified clear seasonal trends, with sales peaking towards the end of the year and dipping at the beginning.
* Category Comparison: Analyzed and compared sales trends between Furniture and Office Supplies, revealing that Office Supplies had a stronger growth trend over time.
